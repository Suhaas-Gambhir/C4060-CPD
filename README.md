# C4060-CPD

## Overview (Phase 2)
The Continuous Professional Development (CPD) project phase II centers on the initiative to develop a sophisticated web application, notably a Note-taking Draw App integrated with Google Calendar API. To achieve this we use web development framwork, React or Next.js which provide us the building blocks to create fast, full-stack web applications [1]. This project aims to leverage existing projects like "perfect freehand" and "tldraw" to achieve features like pen integration for drawing and note-taking, text-input, and exporting functionalities. Further, this project tries to create well-coordinated with Google Calendar
for scheduling and note linking. This undertaking is inspired by solutions like GoodNotes for Windows and Microsoft Journal/Whiteboard, and tries to bring together the good aspects of each in this one application. In addition, we also explore deployment platforms and evaluate the selected option based on cost, ease of use, security, etc.

## Improvement areas
As someone graduating soon as a Software Engineer, I want to improve in the following areas:
- Learning Goal 1: Gain Understanding of Web Application Development Frameworks
  -- Devloping full-stack web applications using React framework (Next.js)
  -- Understanding React concepts such as context API, hooks, and custom hooks.
  -- Learn about server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) with React frameworks (Next.js).
- Learning Goal 2: API Integration in Web Applications
  -- 



## CPD Learning Outcomes related to your SELECTED learning goal / goals for this CPD.
For this CPD, I want to focus on the following learning goal / learning goals.

Stated learning outcomes for the CPD based on the learning goal / goals:

"by the end of this CPD I want to be able to :"

- Learning Outcome 1: By the end of this CPD I want to be able to 
- Learning Outcome 2: By the end of this CPD I want to be able to successfully integrate an API within a Web Application.

Consider looking at Bloom's taxonomy for guidance on "levels of learning achievement": https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/

## measures of your learning success (for your CPD)
How will you measure / assess if you have met your desired learning outcomes in full, in part, not at all?

## what is your definition of done (for your project)

## What is your 6-week timeline? 
Breakdown of tasks / goals / deliverables for each week.

## Interim off-ramps that still allow you to complete your learning goals + potential risk factors to monitor.
