# COMP4060-CPD

## Overview (Phase 2)
The Continuous Professional Development (CPD) project phase II centers on the initiative to develop a sophisticated web application, notably a Note-taking Draw App integrated with Google Calendar API. To achieve this we use web development framwork, React or Next.js which provide us the building blocks to create fast, full-stack web applications [1]. This project aims to leverage existing libraries like "perfect-freehand" [2] and "tldraw" [3] to achieve features like pen integration for drawing and note-taking, text-input, and exporting functionalities. Further, this project tries to create well-coordinated with Google Calendar
for scheduling and note linking. This undertaking is inspired by solutions like GoodNotes for Windows and Microsoft Journal/Whiteboard, and tries to bring together the good aspects of each in this one application. In addition, we also explore deployment platforms and evaluate the selected option based on cost, ease of use, security, etc.


## Improvement areas
As someone graduating soon as a Software Engineer, I want to improve in the following areas:

- Learning Goal 1: Gain Understanding of Web Application Development Frameworks
  - Devloping full-stack web applications using React framework (Next.js)
  - Understanding React concepts such as context API, hooks, and custom hooks.
  - Learn about server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) with React frameworks (Next.js).

- Learning Goal 2: API Integration in Web Applications
  - To successfully implement API integration, specifically linking the app with Google Calendar to associate notes with specified classes or documents.
 
- Learning Goal 3: Explore Deployment Platforms and evaluate options based on specific criteria
  - Evaluate the selected option based on cost, ease of use, security, etc.


## CPD Learning Outcomes
For this CPD, I want to focus on the following learning goal / learning goals.

Stated learning outcomes for the CPD based on the learning goal / goals:

"by the end of this CPD I want to be able to :"

- Learning Outcome 1: ... create a web application using web development framework.
- Learning Outcome 2: ... successfully integrate an API within a Web Application.
- Learning Outcome 3: ... Assess the chosen deployment platform against set criteria, reflecting on the application's readiness for realworld deployment.

## Measures of your learning success (for your CPD)
How will you measure / assess if you have met your desired learning outcomes in full, in part, not at all?
- Self evalutaion of meeting the project learning objectives/outcomes.
- Is the app functionable?
- Have all the features listed at the initial phase been implented?
- Does the API integrated actaully work?

## Definition of done (for your project)
For my project, having a functional MVP of the drawing-notetaking application hosted on a non-local server would be considered done. Through this process I should be able to look back at the learning goals and objectives and evaluate my success. 

## 6-week Poject Timeline
Breakdown of tasks / goals / deliverables for each week.
- Week 1: Research phase focusing on framework selection, API documentation study, and basic implementation planning.
- Week 2-4: Development sprints targeting the main features: Draw Canvas Apllication, API integration, and ....
- Week 5: Deployment tasks â€“ understanding deployment strategies, selecting a platform, and deploying the application.
- Week 6: Comprehensive documentation, addressing and fixing any bugs, and evaluating the project against initial objectives and expected outcomes.

## Interim off-ramps that still allow you to complete your learning goals + potential risk factors to monitor.
- Integration Complexity: Challenges in integrating Google Calendar API and input methods might extend beyond anticipated timelines. Regular progress checks and fallback strategies will be planned.
- Learning Curve: The learning curve for a new framework and deployment practices could be steep. Setting aside additional time for tutorials and bug fixes will mitigate this.
- Deployment Hurdles: Security, cost, and ease of use for deployment might not align perfectly with expectations, necessitating a reassessment of platform choices.
- Reaccess and Adjust: There is always a possibility of not meeting the deadlines or the objectives defined at the initial stage of the project. Re-assessment of goals weekly to make sure the timeline is met is a top priority.
